Certainly! To use `xdelta` for delta compression in Python, you can use the `xdelta3` library. Here's a basic example demonstrating how to create and apply a delta:

### Prerequisites
First, ensure that you have `xdelta3` installed. You can install it using:

```sh
pip install xdelta3
```

### Example

1. **Creating a Delta:**

   Suppose you have two versions of a text file, `original.txt` and `new_version.txt`. You can create a delta that represents the difference between them.

```python
import xdelta3

# Read the original and new file contents
with open("original.txt", "rb") as original_file, open("new_version.txt", "rb") as new_file:
    original_data = original_file.read()
    new_data = new_file.read()

# Create a delta
delta = xdelta3.encode(original_data, new_data)

# Save the delta to a file
with open("delta.xd3", "wb") as delta_file:
    delta_file.write(delta)

print("Delta created successfully!")
```

2. **Applying the Delta:**

   To reconstruct the new version from the original and the delta, you can use the following code:

```python
import xdelta3

# Read the original file and the delta
with open("original.txt", "rb") as original_file, open("delta.xd3", "rb") as delta_file:
    original_data = original_file.read()
    delta = delta_file.read()

# Apply the delta to the original data
new_data = xdelta3.decode(original_data, delta)

# Save the reconstructed file
with open("reconstructed.txt", "wb") as reconstructed_file:
    reconstructed_file.write(new_data)

print("New version reconstructed successfully!")
```

### Explanation
- **Creating a Delta:**
  - The `xdelta3.encode()` function generates a delta from the original and new data.
  - This delta is then saved to a file (`delta.xd3`).

- **Applying the Delta:**
  - The `xdelta3.decode()` function takes the original data and the delta to reconstruct the new version.
  - The reconstructed data is then saved to a new file (`reconstructed.txt`).

This is a simple example. In practice, you might need to handle larger files and more complex data, but the basic principles remain the same.
